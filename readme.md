# Node.js Ecommerce Project

This is an eCommerce web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Admins can manage the product catalog, orders, and users. The backend provides RESTful APIs for handling these operations.

## Features

- User authentication (login, registration)
- Product listing and categorization
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order management (for users and admins)
- Admin dashboard to manage products and orders
- MongoDB as the database for storing products, users, and orders
- Secure payment gateway integration (optional)

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to build the server-side application
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and API requests
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing product information, user details, and orders
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication
- **Bcrypt.js**: For hashing passwords
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js
